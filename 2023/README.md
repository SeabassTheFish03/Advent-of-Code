# One Liners!
I'm trying to do every challenge in a one-liner, which in practice means some ridiculous method chains. Very similar to what I tried with last year's Advent except I'm using a language which has better infrastructure for functional programming (and also I like it better).

It's not pretty, but it is mind-bending and pretty fun.
